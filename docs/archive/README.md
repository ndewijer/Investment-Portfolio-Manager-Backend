## Archive Policy

Documents are archived when:
- A feature is complete and no longer actively evolving
- Implementation details are preserved for reference but not needed for day-to-day work
- The information has historical value but isn't part of the active documentation set

Archived documents remain accessible via git history even if removed from this folder.
