# Investment Portfolio Manager - Go Backend

A personal learning project rebuilding the Investment Portfolio Manager backend in Go. This project is part of my journey to learn Go by reimplementing a production Python/Flask backend that manages investment fund portfolios, transactions, and dividend tracking.

**Important:** This backend is being built **manually by me, not AI-generated**. Every line of code is written to understand Go fundamentals, patterns, and best practices. The implementation follows a phased approach starting with raw `database/sql` to learn the foundations before migrating to modern tools like `sqlc` and Atlas.

## Project Status
🚧 **In Active Development** - 83% complete (60/72 endpoints implemented)

This is a ground-up rewrite of the [Investment Portfolio Manager backend](https://github.com/ndewijer/Investment-Portfolio-Manager) from Python/Flask to Go. The goal is to achieve feature parity while learning Go idioms, patterns, and ecosystem.

### Tech Stack

- **Language:** Go 1.23+
- **Web Framework:** Chi router (stdlib-compatible)
- **Database Driver:** modernc.org/sqlite (pure Go, no CGO)
- **Database Access:**
  - Phase 1-2: `database/sql` (learning fundamentals)
  - Phase 3+: `sqlc` + Atlas (type-safe code generation)
- **Testing:** Go testing + testify/assert
- **Logging:** Structured logging with levels and categories

## API Implementation Status

This backend aims to replicate all 73 endpoints from the Python backend. Below is the current implementation status:

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or higher
- SQLite database from the Python backend (or create new)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ndewijer/Investment-Portfolio-Manager-Backend.git
cd Investment-Portfolio-Manager-Backend

# Create environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Run the server
make run
# or
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:5001` by default.

### Testing the Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:5001/api/system/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "database": "connected"
}
```

### Development Commands

```bash
make run          # Run development server

### Architecture Overview

The application follows a clean layered architecture:

```
HTTP Request → Router → Handler → Service → Database
                ↓
          Middleware (logging, CORS, recovery)
```

**Layers:**
- **API Layer** (`internal/api/`): HTTP concerns (routing, middleware, request/response)
- **Service Layer** (`internal/service/`): Business logic, validation, orchestration
- **Database Layer** (`internal/database/`): Data access patterns

This separation ensures:
- Testable components (can test services without HTTP)
- Reusable logic (services can be called from CLI, workers, etc.)
- Clear dependencies (API → Service → Database, never backwards)

## Development Approach

### Phase 1-2: Learning with database/sql ✅ Complete

Built with raw `database/sql` to understand:
- How query execution works
- Pointer semantics and scanning
- Transaction management
- Error handling patterns
- NULL value handling

**Benefits:**
- Deep understanding of database operations
- Appreciation for what code generation solves
- Foundation for all Go database work

### Phase 3: Migration to sqlc + Atlas (Planned)

After gaining solid understanding, migrating to:
- **sqlc**: Type-safe code generation from SQL
- **Atlas**: Database schema management and migrations

**Benefits:**
- Compile-time SQL validation
- Type-safe queries
- Reduced boilerplate
- Better maintainability

See [Implementation Plan](docs/GO_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) for detailed migration strategy.

## Key Principles

### 1. Explicit Over Magic
- Prefer readable code over clever abstractions
- Avoid over-engineering
- Keep it simple and clear

### 2. Standard Library First
- Use `database/sql` before ORMs
- Use `net/http` patterns with Chi router
- Leverage Go's excellent standard library

### 3. Learn By Doing
- Write code manually to understand patterns
- Feel the pain points before adding tools
- Build appreciation for productivity tools

### 4. Production-Ready Patterns
- Structured logging with categories
- Proper error handling and wrapping
- Comprehensive testing (95%+ coverage goal)
- Service layer pattern for testability

## Testing

Tests follow Go conventions with comprehensive coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make coverage

# Run specific package
go test ./internal/service/...
```

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests alongside code (`*_test.go`)
- Integration tests for HTTP endpoints
- Test utilities in `internal/testutil/`
- 95%+ coverage target

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through environment variables with `.env` file support:

```env
# Server
SERVER_PORT=5001
SERVER_HOST=localhost

# Database
DB_PATH=./data/portfolio_manager.db

# CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
```

See `.env.example` for all available options.

## Contributing

This is a personal learning project, but feedback and suggestions are welcome! Feel free to:
- Open issues for bugs or questions
- Suggest improvements to code or documentation
- Share Go best practices I might have missed

## Relationship to Original Project

This backend is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the [Python/Flask backend](https://github.com/ndewijer/Investment-Portfolio-Manager). It:
- Uses the same SQLite database schema
- Implements the same REST API endpoints
- Returns the same JSON response formats
- Works with the existing React frontend

The Python backend can run alongside this Go backend during development for comparison and testing.

## Acknowledgments

This project is a learning exercise inspired by the need to consolidate multiple Excel spreadsheets into a single application. The original Python backend was built with LLM assistance; this Go rewrite is being built manually to learn Go from the ground up.

---

**Current Focus:** Completing IBKR and developer endpoints (remaining 25% of API surface).

**Next Steps:** Full IBKR import flow, remaining developer utilities, then Phase 3 migration to sqlc + Atlas.
